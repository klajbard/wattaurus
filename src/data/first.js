      text: "<<Welcome to Wattaurus!>> It's so nice to see you! It's been almost a year since I first decided I need something more formal place to document and archive my projects and knowledge than keeping them in Github [Gists](https://gist.github.com/klajbard) and [Repositories](https://github.com/klajbard). Currently there's mainly private stuff, but will plan to move and create content in the public area. Recently started to develop a homepage to create a diary like project descriptions for these. This will be the place where I collect, organize and share programming and tinkering ideas. I hope I will be able to share at least a part of the joy I feel and encourage you (and of course myself) to be more creative on making our daily lives easier. I will do my best to inspire with ideas and address different subjects all from electrotechnics to developing web applications.",

      text: "Some words about me. I am an electrical engineer working as a frontend developer. The passion of making things alive made me to experiment in Smart Home and IoT subjects. These became more and more popular these days. I usually spend most of my time improving my home automation system which is based on Home Assistant. Light bulbs, hygrometers, consumption calculators, power switches and automations extended with various scrapers for example get current currencies, local covid cases and local fuel prices.",

    {
      text: "Besides electricity I really enjoy programming. My main interest lies in frontend development related technologies, such as HTML, CSS, JavaScript(Node.js, React), but had the possibility to gain basic knowledge of Golang, Ruby, Python and C/C++. I mostly did private stuff until now, but I feel the responsibility to give something valuable back to the community.",

      text: "My philosophy is to gain experience instead of getting theorithical knowledge. Reading books or blogposts are great too but to deepen the knowledge it is a must to do it yourself, experiment and iterate over fail and fix cycles. Try everything which comes in the perspective. There might be a better optimized solution. I've been there, I learned most of the technologies that I know all by myself.",
